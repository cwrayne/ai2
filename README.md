## Troubleshooting
### Windows
Sometimes the setup.exe file is a "threat" according to Windows Defender, so if you click on the notification, click "Protection history", "Threat blocked", "Actions" and then "Allow on device" you can download it again and it will work. Alternatively, you can temporarily disable Windows Defender while downloading.
You may also see something like "Windows protected your PC". To continue, press "More info" and then "Run anyway".
### macOS
When you open the app, you will probably see a message like "this app can't be verified."
#### Solve with Administrator Privileges
Open System Preferences/System Settings and go to Privacy and Security. Scroll down until you see something about "AI2.app" and click "Open Anyway". Then click "Open".
#### Solve with No Administrator Privileges
Go to your Applications folder, or the place you installed the app, right click on the app (ctrl+click) and click "Open", and then click "Open".
